# Mutual_Fund_Tracker
This will work similar to before but this is with new parser as old wasnt working. i will keep updating new features so stay tuned.

program written in python, this will get you current and previous portfolio of a mutual fund program also gives appoximate current value of your mutual fund for current time.

This value is not very accurate as mutual fund house do not publish current protfolio but as it doesn chage so much over a month you can get a approx value of that time.

This is helpfull when market is little down but you are not sure if you should invest.

## Funds.py:
Older way to calculate.

## mftracker_async_thread.py:
New faster way to get current mutual fund price.
